<!-- 

During his journey,
Mika found himself in his little piece of heaven.

Mika thought he found his little piece of paradise,
Eternal life was waiting for him.

Furthermore, he went to the gate of heaven,
Obviously looking for a greeter,
Rather than a loner.

Absolutely, totaly.

Comes the time when he found him,
One man standing there,
Only waiting for him.
Khaki dress, golden staff in his hands,
Infernal willings to take Mika to a place he would never forget,
Entering the abyssal reality of hell.
